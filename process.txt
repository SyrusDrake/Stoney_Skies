* The user specifies the proposed size of the painting in degrees in x and y
* The user creates a pattern of markers over a painting
* Reference maps are created. A "master star" is picked and a list is created of all stars within the size limits specified
by the user
* A projected map of this sector is created. Master star is at 0,0. All other stars receive coordinates based on their
VECTORS from the master stars. Those vectors are calculated from their actual celestial coordinates.
* Rectangles are created around the stars with the stars as their center coordinates.
* It is determined whether the markers and the rectangles overlap with find_overlapping (http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/canvas.htm#Tkinter.Canvas.find_overlapping-method)
* If a certain percentage of the markers and rectangles overlap, the current local map is flagged as a "match"
